APRIL BOLT repository.


Dependencies:
-------------------------------------------------------------

You will need to install libfreenect to compile and run the kinect driver.
The Makefile in src assumes the below has been executed in an Ubuntu
distribution. Experiences may vary between systems. If this is the case,
please consult openkinect.org/wiki/Getting_Started for help.

sudo apt-add-respository ppa:floe/libtisch
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libfreenect libfreenect-demos libfreenect-dev


Directions:
-------------------------------------------------------------

--- Simulator ---
To use the simulator, you will need to start two processes:

java april.util.GamePadDriver

and

java abolt.sim.BoltSim --start -w ~/abolt/config/bolt.world

Currently, the simulator fakes a magic, teleporting end effector for an arm.
Button '2' will cause actions to occur, while buttons 1, 3, and 4 will
cause pick up, drop and movement to specific locations. Look at the GamePad
code to see examples of how to interact with the robot.

--- Kinect Driver ---
To run the kinect driver, build kinect.c in src and then run
./kinect from bin. lcm-spy should show kinect_status_t messages at ~30 Hz.

APRIL BOLT repository.


Directions:


You will need to start two processes:

java april.util.GamePadDriver

and

java april.sim.Simulator --start -w ~/abolt/config/bolt.world


Button '2' will cause actions to occur, and also note that at least
one button on the gamepad must be pressed inorder for the robot to
move (this corresponds to the estop being disabled).
